# Autonomous-Vehicle-Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time monitoring of autonomous vehicle data (speed, GPS, steering angle) using ROS, Prometheus, and Grafana.
# Dashboard App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **real-time dashboard** application built to monitor and visualize data efficiently.  
It provides insights into system metrics and live updates in an interactive and user-friendly interface.  

The motivation behind this project was to create a centralized platform where data from multiple sources (e.g., sensors, APIs, ROS topics, or custom servers) can be displayed in real-time for monitoring autonomous systems or IoT devices.
